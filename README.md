# melee-sim-js

TypeScript implementation of a simulator for The Fantasy Trip Melee.

Conversion of melee-sim-js to TypeScript with Jest using Webpack as a bundler (thanks to James L. Milner from the [example](https://github.com/JamesLMilner/webpack-tsc-worker) and [explanation](https://www.jameslmilner.com/post/workers-with-webpack-and-typescript/).)

It's deployed [here](https://fuhrmanator.github.io/melee-sim-ts/dist/).
